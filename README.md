# ChatGPT-Review-Analysis
This project analyzes ChatGPT user reviews to understand sentiment and key themes. It includes data collection, text preprocessing, sentiment analysis with TextBlob, and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. Optionally, topic modeling with LDA reveals common themes in reviews. 

### Project Brief

ChatGPT Reviews Analysis with Python

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of user reviews for ChatGPT using Python, aiming to uncover insights into user sentiments and common themes. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key steps and methodologies used:

1. Data Collection: Reviews are collected through web scraping or APIs. The project uses libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape review data from websites, or it can leverage available APIs from review platforms.

2. Data Preprocessing: The collected text data undergoes cleaning and preprocessing. This includes removing irrelevant characters, converting text to lowercase, tokenizing the text, removing stop words, and performing lemmatization. This step ensures that the text data is in a suitable format for analysis.

3. Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis is performed using the `TextBlob` library. This involves classifying each review into one of three categories: positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment polarity scores are used to determine the overall sentiment of each review.

4. Visualization: The distribution of sentiments is visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Bar charts and pie charts illustrate the proportion of positive, negative, and neutral reviews, providing a clear visual representation of user feedback.

5. Topic Modeling: For deeper insights, topic modeling is conducted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify common themes and topics within the reviews. This step helps in understanding prevalent issues or areas of interest.

6. Deployment (Optional): The analysis can be extended by creating interactive dashboards using tools like Streamlit or Dash, or by deploying a web application to allow users to input and analyze new reviews in real-time.

Basic Steps to Run the Project:

1. Install Required Libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests nltk pandas matplotlib seaborn wordcloud textblob
   ```

2. Collect Data: Use the provided web scraping script or API integration to gather reviews.

3. Preprocess Data: Clean and preprocess the reviews using the preprocessing script.

4. Analyze Sentiments: Run the sentiment analysis code to categorize reviews.

5. Visualize Results: Use the visualization scripts to generate charts showing sentiment distribution.

6. Optional Topic Modeling: Apply LDA to discover common topics if needed.

This project provides a thorough understanding of user sentiments and common themes in reviews, aiding in product improvement and strategic decision-making.
